## Clusters

Particle Life is a fascinating simulation model that showcases emergent behavior arising from simple rules.
This is an effort to simulate this model.

### Rules

1. Particles of the same color attract each other with a specific factor.
2. Particles of different coloer either attract or repel each other with a specific factor.
